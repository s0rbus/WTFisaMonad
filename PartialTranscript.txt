LET

in clojure you can do this
you see I've got a function defined there, called f
f takes no arguments and then it uses this let thing
and if you look at the let you'll get the idea...
the let says a can be 1
and b can be a plus 1
and c can be a plus b
so these are kind of like local variables inside the function
and then I've returned a plus b plus c
that's how you do that in clojure.
What is that let? In any other language that would be part of the language,
a keyword but that is not a keyword, that keyword does not exist in the language,
thats a function. How do you write a function like that, how do you write anything
without local variables? What if you can't declare local variables?
